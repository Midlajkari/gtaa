    <p> Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a B.A. in political
        science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School,
        where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an
        academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He also went
        into elective politics; Obama represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he
        successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was
        nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama
        was elected president, defeating Republican Party nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was
        inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision
        that drew a mixture of criticism and praise.</p>
